    "Clay Soil": {
        "composition": "high in clay particles, low in sand and organic matter, making the soil dense and heavy. It has the ability to retain moisture well but can easily become waterlogged and compacted if not managed properly. ",
        "description": "Clay soil is typically found in cooler, wetter regions and is known for its ability to hold nutrients well, but can be difficult to work with due to its density and tendency to become compacted. It is best suited for crops that prefer moist soil and can handle heavy soil, such as root vegetables."

    "Red Soil": {
        "composition": "high in iron and aluminum, low in organic matter and nutrients. This soil is known for its poor drainage and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.",
        "description": "Red soil is typically found in regions with high temperatures and rainfall. It is generally less fertile than other soil types and can be challenging to grow crops in. However, with proper management, it can be used to grow crops such as rice, cotton, and sugarcane."

    "Black Soil": {
        "composition": "high in organic matter and clay, rich in nutrients. This soil has good water-holding capacity, which makes it suitable for agriculture.",
        "description": "Black soil is also known as 'black cotton soil' because it is ideal for growing cotton. It is typically found in regions with high temperatures and low rainfall. The soil is rich in nutrients and has good water-holding capacity, making it well-suited for growing a wide variety of crops, including wheat, sugarcane, and soybeans."
