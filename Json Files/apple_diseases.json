                "1":"Remove and destroy the fallen leaf litter so that the fungus cannot overwinter. This may reduce the disease pressure in the following spring, but will not likely eliminate the disease.",
                "2":"Do not overcrowd plants, and make sure the canopy has proper airflow. This will decrease the conditions favorable for disease development.",
                "3":"Fungicide applications at 2-week intervals begin when new growth is expanding in the spring.",
                "4":"Crabapple cultivars that are resistant to apple scab are widely available."
